# SPACING AND LAYOUT

Another very iomportat aspect of visual design. How to design a layout using
whitespace. Every piece of good design usses whitespace well.

If you want to make a website that looks designed, you'll need a lot of
whitespace in the correct places on your site.

Whitespace is just a space where there isn't any stuff. It is the key to create
a clean and simple look and feel.

A good example of well used of the whitespace:  
![spacing01](../assets/spacing01.png)

This is the same website without the whitespace:
![spacing02](../assets/spacing02.png)

It feels like no room to breath here. Base on this the guidelines are:

## 1. Use whistespace

- Put whitespace between your elements
- Put whitespace between your groups of elements
- Put whitespace between your website's sections
- But don't exaggerate

## 2. Define hierarchy

Whitespace de4scribes invisible relationships between the elements of your website.

Hierarchy give a website order. Design it having 3 guidelines in mind, and you should be fine.

- Define where you want your audience to look first.
- Establish a flow that corresponds to your content's message
- Use whitespace to build that flow.
