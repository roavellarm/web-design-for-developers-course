# USER EXPERIENCE

`User interface` is the presentation of a product, how it looks and feels.

`User experience` is the overall experience the user has with a product. It includes the user interface but also undestands the whole picture of the product.

_"It's not just what it looks lije and feels like. Design is how it works."_ - Steve Jobs

A good explanation of the difference between designing just the presentation of the product or designing the hole experience.

A UX designer needs to align those goals so that the business benefits when the user reaches their goal (value of the project).
