# Wrapping Up What You'll Learn

- Most of your content will be text, so beautiful typography is a key element to a good looking website.

- Images are getting more and more important in webdesign, so choosing great images and putting text on them is an essential part of your work.

- Icons are also a good way of setting a friendly tone for your website, but use them carefully.

- The adequate use of whitespace makes a website look professionally designed, so use it a lot, but in the correct way.

- Build a layout by defining the visual hierarchy of your content. Whitespace is also important for this.

- Your website should be designed in a way that ensures that both the user and the owner of the website achieve their goals. This is the user experience.

- It is very important that you get inspired by studying well-designed websites from other designers.
